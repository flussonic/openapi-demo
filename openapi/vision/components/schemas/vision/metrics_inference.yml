  detections_count:
    description: |
      Total number of detected objects.  
      Consists of 4 buckets: rejected by confidence, size, orientation and accepted detections.  
      Each bucket is represented by number of detections in that bucket
    
      For each rejection reason there is a cumulative _quality_ metric for all detections
      and cumulative _quality_ metric for accepted detections

      For example:  
      `detections_confidence` is a cumulative confidence of _all_ detections  
      `detections_accepted_confidence` is a cumulative confidence of _accepted_ detections

      `detections_area` is a cumulative size of _all_ detections  
      `detections_accepted_area` is a cumulative size of _accepted_ detections

  fingerprints_count:

      Total number of fingerprinted objects
      Consists of 2 buckets: rejected by confidence and accepted fingerprints.  
      Each bucket is represented by number of fingerprints in that bucket
    
      For each rejection reason there is a cumulative _quality_ metric for all fingerprints
      and cumulative _quality_ metric for accepted fingerprints

      For example:  
      `fingerprints_confidence` is a cumulative confidence of _all_ fingerprints  
      `fingerprints_accepted_confidence` is a cumulative confidence of _accepted_ fingerprints
