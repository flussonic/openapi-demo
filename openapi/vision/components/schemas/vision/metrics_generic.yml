  processed_frames_count:
    description: |
      The number of frames that were processed by videoanalytics.
      This number may be less than `input_frames` because some input frames can be skipped depending on the hardware capabilities.

  frame_preprocessing_time:
    description: Total time spent on frame preprocessing to make a batch. It includes frame resizing and chroma channels planarization, if needed
    type: integer
