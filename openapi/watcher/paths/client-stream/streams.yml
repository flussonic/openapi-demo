get:
  operationId: streams_list
  summary: List streams
  description: |
    This API method is one of the most important in whole API, because it gives the list of all streams,
    including:

    * configured (may not be running at the moment)
    * running (including those that are created via a template and do not have own disk configuration)
    * remote (available from other servers)
    * only recorded

    Together with the `stream_save` method you can manage streams in Flussonic.

    You can pass all stream configuration options to query string for filtering, not only specified in the parameters.

    This method and `stream_get` will return `effective stream configuration` with all templates, overrides, defaults
    included into this response. It is not exactly what you can see in the disk config. If you have configured
    this stream in the disk file, then the original disk configuration can be found in the field `config_on_disk`.

    What you get from this API call is not what you write to `stream_save`.

  operationId: stream_create
  summary: Create stream
  description: |
    Create stream with autogenerated steam name.
    Cloud stream name will be returned in response.
    Note: property name in request body not required and will be ignored.
    If project_id passed in request body stream will created in specified project,
    otherwise in default project.
    Recommended set header Idempotency-Key with uuid4 as value, this will avoid 
    duplication of streams with repeated requests.

  parameters:
  - name: Idempotency-Key
    in: header

      An idempotency key is a unique value generated by the client which 
      the server uses to recognize subsequent retries of the same request.
