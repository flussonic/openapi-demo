  summary: Save stream
  description: |
    Create or update a stream by its name.
    If the stream doesn't exists in the disk config, it will be created.

    If you try to update a stream that is started from a template by a user request
    having `named_by=user`, a new stream will be created in the disk config.

    If you pass only a partial stream configuration, this field will be updated, not the whole stream.
    
    To create a new stream the property `name` is required.

    Pass the `"$reset": true` option to replace the stream configuration with the provided one.
  parameters:
  - name: name

    description: |
      The stream is configured by several origins of configuration. It may be `config_on_disk`
      or temporary runtime `config_override` that can be provided via `on_play` or `on_publish`
      backend, or edited via this API call if you pass `config_override` to this parameter.

delete:
  operationId: stream_delete
  summary: Delete the stream
  description: |
    This method allows to delete a single stream. You can delete `config_override` by this API call if you want
    to remove all runtime overrides.

    If you do not specify any `part` parameter, this stream will be deleted from `config_on_disk`
    and if it was `named_by: config`, then it will immediately stop.
