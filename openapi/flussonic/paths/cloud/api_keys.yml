    Create a new API key for the specified `project_ids` and `scope`. 

    The first API key is available in the Flussonic Cloud web UI.

    Note: the `key_id` property in the request body is not required and will be ignored,
    but will be auto generated and returned in the response. 
    
    You will use the `bearer` value to authenticate your API requests. 
    It is only returned once in response to this POST request so make sure to save it.

    If the `project_ids`parameter is not specified, it will be set to the default project for your account.

    If `scope` is not selected, it will be `admin`.
