      Requested list of streams. If some stream is not returned,
      then all content for this will be erased.
      
      If you cannot fetch this information for any reasons and not sure
      that you are ready to delete all old DVR for the requested stream,
      better fail with 
    explode: false

      type: string
    style: form
  - name: opened_at_lt
    description: |
      If you want to fetch episodes earlier than 1 day ago, you need to skip all new episodes,
      so you need those episodes, whose `opened_at` is in past, i.e. `less than = lt` then 1 day ago.

      The meaning of this parameter is following: all episodes with `time =< opened_at`
      (opposite to requested) are very new and not interesting for the requester. Only old enough episodes
      with `opened_at` far in the past can be interesting to us.
    in: query
    required: false

      type: integer

  - name: closed_at_gt
    description: |
      Streamer may use this field to skip asking for dozens of very old episodes that were fetched
      some requests ago. For example: it may take sense to ask for episodes in the period from 2 days ago to
      1 day ago. Everything older is not interesting and it takes too much time to fetch it.

      Use this query option to fetch only required subset of episodes, reduce requested dataset to
      only required small amount.
