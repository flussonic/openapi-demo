  description: |
    Create or update a stream by its name.
    If the stream doesn't exists in the disk config, it will be created.

    If you pass only a partial stream configuration, just the passed field(s) will be updated, not the whole stream.
    
    To create a new stream the property `name` is required.

    Pass the `"$reset": true` option to replace the stream configuration with the provided one.
