  description: |
    If your stream is already recorded on the server with DVR, you can use this URL to play a specified DVR window, for example,
    you can play a telecast if you know its beginning and end from EPG.

    This URL works in two modes: file and event. If `duration` is specified as `now`, this
    url will respond with a growing playlist for playing an event.

    If `duration` is an exact positive number, then the server will respond with playlist, having
    this requested amount of seconds of video as a file.

    Note the following rules:

      * The first segment in this playlist will not start earlier than `from`.
      * The last segment in this playlist will not start later than `from + duration`.
