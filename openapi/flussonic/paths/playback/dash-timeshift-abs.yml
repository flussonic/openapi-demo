      If this parameter is specified, the thumbnail playlist is added to the primary playlist.

      Example of the thumbnail playlist:
      ```
       <AdaptationSet id="3" mimeType="image/jpeg" contentType="image">
               <SegmentTemplate media="$RepresentationID$/dvr-1648098000-$Time$.m4v.jpg" duration="775"></SegmentTemplate>
               <Representation bandwidth="10000" id="images-320x240" width="320" height="240">
                  <EssentialProperty schemeIdUri="http://dashif.org/guidelines/thumbnail_tile" value="1x1"/>
               </Representation>
        </AdaptationSet>
      ```

      This value defines how many thumbnail links will be added to the thumbnail playlist to cover the
      requested duration of the DVR window.
      The player will add the thumbnail links to the progress bar at regular intervals.
      The duration of the interval between thumbnails is the whole duration of the DVR window divided by this value.

      NOTE: This option requires the parameters `thumbnails enabled=ondemand` and `size` included in the stream settings. 
      For example, `thumbnails enabled=ondemand size=320x240;`.
