    If your stream is already recorded on the server with DVR, you can use this URL to play a specified DVR window, for example,
    you can play a telecast if you know its beginning and end from EPG.

    This URL works in two modes: file and event. If `duration` is specified as `now`, this
    url will respond with a growing playlist for playing an event.

    If `duration` is an exact positive number, then the server will respond with playlist, having
    this requested amount of seconds of video as a file.

    Note the following rules:

      * The first segment in this playlist will not start earlier than `from`.
      * The last segment in this playlist will not start later than `from + duration`.
  parameters:
  - name: name

      The duration of the DVR window in seconds. 

      You also can specify `now` for a growing playlist till current time.

      If `from`+`duration` is in the future, the playlist will grow as well until it reaches the specified moment.

      Flussonic can create DASH manifest of two types: with multiple periods and with a single period. 

      By default, Flussonic creates a multi-period manifest. If there is a gap in playing a stream (for example, when the stream is restarted) or video quality changes,
      Flussonic starts a new period of playing, so there are multiple continuous periods in the resulting playlist.

      However, such a manifest is incompatible with a wide range of devices and TV sets. 
      In such cases you can specify `period=mono` option, i.e. `http://FLUSSONIC-IP/STREAMNAME/archive-TIME-DURATION.mpd?period=mono`.
      As a result, Flussonic will recalculate timestamps of all frames and join the parts of the interrupted video together into a single period. 

      Please note that this option should not work in the event mode because Flussonic cannot join a period in future.
    required: false
    schema:
      type: string
      enum:
        - mono
  - name: thumbnails
    in: query

      If this parameter is specified, the thumbnail playlist is added to the primary playlist.

      Example of the thumbnail playlist:
      ```
       <AdaptationSet id="3" mimeType="image/jpeg" contentType="image">
               <SegmentTemplate media="$RepresentationID$/dvr-1648098000-$Time$.m4v.jpg" duration="771"></SegmentTemplate>
               <Representation bandwidth="10000" id="images-320x240" width="320" height="240">
                  <EssentialProperty schemeIdUri="http://dashif.org/guidelines/thumbnail_tile" value="1x1"/>
               </Representation>
        </AdaptationSet>
      ```

      This value defines how many thumbnail links will be added to the thumbnail playlist to cover the
      requested duration of the DVR window.
      The player will add the thumbnail links to the progress bar at regular intervals.
      The duration of the interval between thumbnails is the whole duration of the DVR window divided by this value.

      NOTE: This option requires the parameters `thumbnails enabled=ondemand` and `size` included in the stream settings. 
      For example, `thumbnails enabled=ondemand size=320x240;`.
