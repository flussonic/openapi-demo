  summary: MP4 thumbnail
  description: |
    Use this URL to get the last video thumbnail (keyframe) of a stream or a VOD file in MP4 format.

    Video thumbnails are essentially fragments of H.264 video each containing one frame.
    Flussonic takes the first keyframe from each segment of a stream or a VOD file and creates an MP4 file from it. 
    This file is sent to the browser, where it is then shown as a picture.
