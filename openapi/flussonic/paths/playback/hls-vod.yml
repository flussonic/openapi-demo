      Name of the VOD file. It consists of two segments separated by slash:

      Whether audio tracks are specified separately in the playlist.
      
      This option is used for some players like Samsung TV or browsers supporting MSE that cannot switch between 
      multiple audio tracks (for instance, for different languages) and, as a result, do not display such audio tracks. 
      For such cases, Flussonic can create a playlist with separate audio.
    schema:
      type: boolean
      example: true
    required: false
  - name: thumbnails
    in: query
    description: |
      If this parameter is specified, the thumbnail playlist is added to the primary playlist.

      Example of the thumbnail playlist:
      
      ```
      #EXT-X-IMAGE-STREAM-INF:BANDWIDTH=10000,RESOLUTION=320x180,CODECS="jpeg",URI="images-320x180/tpl-0-34-100.m3u8"
      ```
      
      This value defines how many thumbnail links will be added to the thumbnail playlist to cover the file duration.
      The player will add the thumbnail links to the progress bar at regular intervals. 
      The duration of the interval between thumbnails is the whole duration of the file divided by this value.

      NOTE: This option requires the parameters `thumbnails enabled=ondemand` and `size` included in the VOD location settings. 
      For example, `thumbnails enabled=ondemand size=320x240;`.
