  summary: HLS DVR
  description: |
    If your stream is already recorded on the server with DVR, you can use this URL to play a specified DVR window, for example,
    you can play a telecast if you know its beginning and end from EPG.
    
    This method returns one of two types of HLS playlists:

    * "VOD" is suitable for ended TV shows and events, CCTV recordings
    * "EVENT" is suitable for current events, webinars, and TV shows.
    
    This URL is a recommended way to play DVR, because it allows pausing. If a player can seamlessly 
    switch between different URLs, you can make seamless DVR playback with non-overlapping HLS DVR requests.

      Whether audio tracks are specified separately in the playlist.
      
      This option is used for some players like Samsung TV or browsers supporting MSE that cannot switch between 
      multiple audio tracks (for instance, for different languages) and, as a result, do not display such audio tracks. 
      For such cases, Flussonic can create a playlist with separate audio.
    schema:
      type: boolean
      example: true
    required: false
  - name: thumbnails
    in: query
    description: |
      If this parameter is specified, the thumbnail playlist is added to the primary playlist.

      Example of the thumbnail playlist:
      
      ```
      #EXT-X-IMAGE-STREAM-INF:BANDWIDTH=10000,RESOLUTION=320x240,CODECS="jpeg",URI="images-320x240/tpl-1644304617-60-100.m3u8"
      ```

      This value defines how many thumbnail links will be added to the thumbnail playlist to cover the
      requested duration of the DVR window.
      The player will add the thumbnail links to the progress bar at regular intervals.
      The duration of the interval between thumbnails is the whole duration of the DVR window divided by this value.

      NOTE: This option requires the parameters `thumbnails enabled=ondemand` and `size` included in the stream settings. 
      For example, `thumbnails enabled=ondemand size=320x240;`.
    schema:

  - name: event

      By default, the VOD playlist is returned unless "duration=now" was requested.

      Using an 'event' option its type can be changed to the 'EVENT' if playlist has the end of the requested range in the future.

      When the end of the requested range is passed (for archive-1641045644-5000.m3u8 it will be at 1641050644 UTC), the playlist will change its type to VOD, as no new segments are expected.

      Please note that most hls players start playing the VOD playlist at the beginning and the EVENT playlist at the live edge (the very end of the playlist).

      The default behaviour (always VOD) makes players behave consistently, but players will not request updated playlists.
