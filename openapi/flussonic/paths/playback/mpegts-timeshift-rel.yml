  summary: HTTP-MPEGTS relative timeshift
  description: |
    If your stream is being recorded on the server with DVR, you can use this URL to play the recorded stream by HTTP-MPEGTS with a specified delay. 
    This can be useful, for example, for TV broadcasting in different time zones, so that people in a different time zone watch morning broadcasts in the morning, and not late at night.
