  summary: HLS absolute timeshift
  description: |
    If your stream is already recorded on the server with DVR, you can use this URL to play the recorded stream by HLS starting at a specified moment of time.
    For example, you can use it for old STBs or viewing recoreded shows with EPG.
    
    Please note that when you use the same timeshift URL several times, any additional requests use the same existing session. 
    Therefore the time is not pure "absolute" and is still related to the current session.
    Therefore every time you request the same time, you get different part of the video.
    To solve this problem, you can change the token parameter in every new request to start a new session. 
    For example:
    
    * `http://FLUSSONIC-IP:80/CHANNEL-NAME/timeshift_abs-1430227800.m3u8?token=123` - the first request,
    * `http://FLUSSONIC-IP:80/CHANNEL-NAME/timeshift_abs-1430227800.m3u8?token=124` - the second request, and so on.

      Whether audio tracks are specified separately in the playlist.

      This option is used for some players like Samsung TV or browsers supporting MSE that cannot switch between 
      multiple audio tracks (for instance, for different languages) and, as a result, do not display such audio tracks. 
      For such cases, Flussonic can create a playlist with separate audio.
