  summary: JPEG thumbnail from DVR
  description: |
    If you configure JPEG thumbnail generation and DVR for a stream, 
    this URL can be used to access the stream's recorded thumbnail (keyframe) which is the closest to the specified time as a JPEG image.

    If no thumbnails are recorded then `404 Not Found` will be returned.

    Note that generating JPEG thumbnails is a resource-intensive operation 
    because Flussonic takes the first keyframe of each segment, decodes it to raw video, and encodes back to a JPEG image. 
    Please consider using MP4 video thumbnails instead.
