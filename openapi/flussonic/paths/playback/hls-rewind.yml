  description: |
    Nice combination of live and DVR HLS playlists.

    This request gives something like HLS live playlist, but with lot of segments.

    If the player understands that there are too many segments for a plain live playlist,
    it allows to rewind back into DVR window.

    We recommend to take a look at Clappr player that supports this feature out of the box.

      DVR window size in seconds.
      It is a duration of an HLS manifest in seconds, so your clients will be able to pause the stream up to this period or rewind it, for example, to the start of a TV show.

      Whether audio tracks are specified separately in the playlist.
      
      This option is used for some players like Samsung TV or browsers supporting MSE that cannot switch between 
      multiple audio tracks (for instance, for different languages) and, as a result, do not display such audio tracks. 
      For such cases, Flussonic can create a playlist with separate audio.
