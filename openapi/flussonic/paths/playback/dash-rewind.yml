    Nice combination of live and DVR DASH playlists.

    This request gives a playlist with a wide sliding window that allows you to rewind DASH streams and pause them for many hours.

    For example, the playlist "rewind-7200.mpd" allows your clients to pause the stream for up to 2 hours or rewind to the start of a TV show without using catchup URLs.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    in: path
    description: Stream name. It may be multi-segment, i.e. `/part1/part2/part3`.
    required: true
    schema:
      type: string
      example: clock
  - name: ago

      DVR window size in seconds.
      It is a duration of a DASH manifest in seconds, so your clients will be able to pause the stream up to this period or rewind it, for example, to the start of a TV show.
    required: true
    schema:
      type: integer
      example: 7200
  - name: thumbnails
    in: query

      If this parameter is specified, the thumbnail playlist is added to the primary playlist.

      Example of the thumbnail playlist:
      ```
       <AdaptationSet id="3" mimeType="image/jpeg" contentType="image">
               <SegmentTemplate media="$RepresentationID$/dvr-1648098000-$Time$.m4v.jpg" duration="72"></SegmentTemplate>
               <Representation bandwidth="10000" id="images-320x240" width="320" height="240">
                  <EssentialProperty schemeIdUri="http://dashif.org/guidelines/thumbnail_tile" value="1x1"/>
               </Representation>
        </AdaptationSet>
      ```

      This value defines how many thumbnail links will be added to the thumbnail playlist to cover the
      requested duration of the DVR window.
      The player will add the thumbnail links to the progress bar at regular intervals.
      The duration of the interval between thumbnails is the whole duration of the DVR window divided by this value.

      NOTE: This option requires the parameters `thumbnails enabled=ondemand` and `size` included in the stream settings. 
      For example, `thumbnails enabled=ondemand size=320x240;`.
