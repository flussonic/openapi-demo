      The UTC moment after which Flussonic will search for the first keyframe to generate MP4 file from.

      If you know that somewhere in 10 minutes after a point in time you have recorded video, you can request unexistent URL (with approximate time).
      Flussonic will find the existing keyframe in that period of time and return it. 
      This approach will save your cache: the browser will make two requests, but only the existing keyframe will be saved to the browser cache.
