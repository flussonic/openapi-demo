  summary: HLS relative timeshift

    If your stream is being recorded on the server with DVR, you can use this URL to play the recorded stream by HLS with a specified delay.
    This can be useful, for example, for TV broadcasting in different time zones, 
    so that people in a different time zone watch morning broadcasts in the morning, and not late at night.

      Whether audio tracks are specified separately in the playlist.
      
      This option is used for some players like Samsung TV or browsers supporting MSE that cannot switch between 
      multiple audio tracks (for instance, for different languages) and, as a result, do not display such audio tracks. 
      For such cases, Flussonic can create a playlist with separate audio.
