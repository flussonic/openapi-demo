  summary: Stop the stream

    Stop the stream with a specified name.

    If the stream is static, it will restart according to existing rules.

    This API call is a replacement for both: stop and restart.

    Server cannot restart a stream that was started by user (publish for example),
    because it cannot ask user to repeat publishing.

    Static stream declared in config will be started automatically as if it failed
    due to any bug.

    This is why `restart` is actually a `stop` and maybe `start`, while `start` is made
    by live stream subsystem
