    This method allows to get the list of all event sinks (former `notify`) configured in Flussonic.

    Each event sink is an instruction for Flussonic to send events to some target. 
    In particular, you can configure sending events to an event handler or writing them to a log file.

    Event sink has its unique name just for management purposes,
    event filtering instructions and target for sending events.
