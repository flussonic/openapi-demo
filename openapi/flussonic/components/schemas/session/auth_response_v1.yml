          The version of ad insertion mechanism used by Flussonic. 

          The first mechanism is an extension of the authorization system, it works with HLS and DASH protocols only.
          Plugins such as AdBlock can block the advertisement.

          By default, the second mechanism is used. It complicates the work of ad blockers. 
          It replaces the stream segments within the play session so that it is impossible to distinguish whether it is a main stream segment or an ad segment. 
          It also allows you to customize the advertisements for a particular user. 
          Besides, it works with a single-period as well as a multi-period DASH.
