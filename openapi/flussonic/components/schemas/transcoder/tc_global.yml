      If this parameter is se to `true` (by default), the transcoder runs in a separate process from Flussonic.

      If it is set to `false`, the transcoder will run in the same process as Flussonic. 
      This mode speeds up encoding, especially when encoding audio or when using an Nvidia device. 
      However, a transcoder error may cause Flussonic to crash.

    x-private: true
    description: Do not bind frames timestamps to realtime before transcoding (disables timestamps being monotonic even if source switches/restarts).

    description: FPS (frames per second) value to be applied for any video track in the stream. May be overridden for a track.

  gop:
    description: |
      GOP (group of pictures) size (in frames) to be applied for any video track in the stream.
      The encoder will create all GOPs of an exactly identical size - as specified in this option.
      May be overridden for a track.

  resize_mode:
