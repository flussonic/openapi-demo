      Audio bitrate. The allowed values are:

      * `copy` - the bitrate or the original stream is copied to the outgoing stream.
      * a full number of bits (e.g., 64000) or a short form of the number with `k` (e.g., 64k).

  sample_rate:
    description: |
      Sample rate, in hertz - 
      the number of samples per second taken from a continuous signal to make a discrete or digital signal.
      The allowed values are: 
      `0` - to copy input sample rate, a number (input audio is resampled with equalization), or the empty value (equalization without resampling)
    nullable: true

  avol:
    description: |
      Output audio volume. The value can be specified in decibels (dB) or it can be an integer/float (3, 0.5, etc.).

      If it is just an integer or a float, the output audio volume is calculated by this formula:

      `output_volume = avol * input_volume`

      If specified in decibels (dB), the output audio volume is calculated as follows:

      `output_volume = input_volume +/- avol`

      depending whether it is a positive (+9dB) or a negative value (-6dB).
      
      By default it equals to 1 (the input audio volume).
