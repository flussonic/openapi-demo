- title: VBR
  const: vbr
  description: |
    The encoder will not encode a stream to be DVB compliant.
    However, VBR (Variable Bit Rate) produces better compression compared to CBR at about the same quality.
- title: CBR
  const: cbr
  description: |
    The encoder will produce a DVB compliant stream.
    The bitrate of the output stream will be stable to fit the fixed-bandwidth channel. 
    In other words, we guarantee that the bitrate has a certain upper bound in a sliding window.
- title: CBR2pass
  const: cbr2pass
  description: |
    The encoder will encode the video once in CBR, 
    then it will encode it second time in CBR but using the information from the previous pass to improve quality.
