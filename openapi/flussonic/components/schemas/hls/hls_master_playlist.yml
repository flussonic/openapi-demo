      The EXT-X-MEDIA tag is used to relate Media Playlists that contain
      alternative Renditions of the same content.  For
      example, three EXT-X-MEDIA tags can be used to identify audio-only
      Media Playlists that contain English, French and Spanish Renditions
      of the same presentation.  Or two EXT-X-MEDIA tags can be used to
      identify video-only Media Playlists that show two different camera
      angles.

      The EXT-X-STREAM-INF tag specifies a Variant Stream, which is a set
      of Renditions which can be combined to play the presentation.  The
      attributes of the tag provide information about the Variant Stream.

      The EXT-X-I-FRAME-STREAM-INF tag identifies a Media Playlist file
      containing the I-frames of a multimedia presentation.
      The EXT-X-IMAGE-STREAM-INF tag identifies an Image Media Playlist file
      containing Images in a compressed graphic image format.
      It stands alone, in that it does not apply to a particular URI in the
      Multivariant Playlist.
