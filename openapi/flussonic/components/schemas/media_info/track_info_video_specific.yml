  last_gop:
    description: |
      Last GOP size (expressed in number of frames).
      This parameter is used to monitor the quality of encoding: normally, average GOP size should be equal to the last GOP size.
      If this value is floating, this means that your transcoder is working in a flexible GOP size mode and some players may have problems.
      This is not acceptable by most ABR usecases and it will not pass DVB validation protocol.
