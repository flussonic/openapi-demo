  frame_duration:
    description: |
      For video track, it is the time between the beginning of a frame and the beginning of the next frame.

      This parameter is important for some protocols. Normally, frame duration is a difference between timestamps of two neighbouring frames.
      However, sometimes (when the connection is broken) video breakups are possible.
      As result, the delta between two consequent frame timestamps will not be equal to the frame duration.
      This situation is considered as a frame gap and is handled differently across different protocols.

  avg_fps:
    description: |
      Actual average FPS - the number of frames diplayed per second (calculated for the last 200 frames).
      The higher FPS is, the smoother the video playback is. 
      Usually, standard values of FPS for films and video are used in different countries (for example, in Russia and Europe it is 25 FPS).
