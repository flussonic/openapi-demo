      a=rtpmap:121 rtx/90000
      a=fmtp:121 apt=102`

      According to https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4588 codec rtx means
      that it is possible to request retransmit of packets.
      `apt` (associated payload type) points at this payload that is retransmitable.

      `packetization-mode=1` in SDP means that H264 can be packed with FU-A.
      `packetization-mode=0` is not practically used.
    nullable: true

      a=fmtp:120 max-fs=12288;max-fr=60
      a=fmtp:111 minptime=10`

      This attribute allows parameters that are specific to a
      particular format to be conveyed in a way that SDP does not
      have to understand them.

      https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3264:
        The interpretation of fmtp parameters in an offer depends on the
      parameters. In many cases, those parameters describe specific
      configurations of the media format, and should therefore be processed
      as the media format value itself would be.  This means that the same
      fmtp parameters with the same values MUST be present in the answer if
      the media format they describe is present in the answer.
