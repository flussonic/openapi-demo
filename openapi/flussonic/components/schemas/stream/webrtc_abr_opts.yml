type: object
properties:
  start_track:
    description: |
      Video track number from which playback starts. Possible values: `v1`, `v2`, `v3` and so on.

      If not specified, or an audio track specified (`start_track=a3`), or a video track number does not exist, 
      playback starts with the track number in the middle of the list (e.g. `v2` if you have tracks `v1`, `v2`, and `v3`) 
      and then adjusts to the bandwidth availability.

      If some tracks are excluded by the query parameter `?filter=tracks:...`, Flussonic searches for an available track with a lower number up to v0. 
      If no track with a lower number was found, Flussonic searches for a closest track with a higher number.
    nullable: true
    type: string
    example: v2
  loss_count:
    description: Number of recent packet loss events to consider when switching bitrate.
    default: 2
    type: integer
    x-private: true
  up_window:
    description: Switch bitrate to a higher value if in the last `up_window` number of seconds there were less than `loss_count` lost packets.
    default: 20
    type: integer
    x-private: true
    example: 17
  down_window:
    description: Switch bitrate to a lower value if in the last `down_window` number of seconds there were more than `loss_count` lost packets.
    default: 5
    type: integer
    x-private: true
    example: 6
  ignore_remb:
    description: |
      If `true`, Flussonic ignores REMB (Receiver Estimated Maximum Bitrate) reported by the client when switching bitrate to a higher value.
      If false, the bitrate will not exceed the one sent by the client in the REMB.
    default: true
    type: boolean
    x-private: true
    example: true
  bitrate_prober:
    description: |
      If `true`, Flussonic periodically sends `probe` packets to measure available bandwidth and switches bitrate to a higher value if it possible.
    default: true
    type: boolean
    x-private: true
    example: true
  bitrate_probing_interval:
    description: |
      How often Flussonic sends `probe` packets in seconds
    default: 5
    type: integer
    x-private: true
    example: 6
