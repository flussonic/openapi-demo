      This parameter is used for a mixer stream that uses other streams as its video and audio sources.

      If the parameter is set to `realtime`, audio frames will be played in sync with video frames: 
      if the difference between timestamps of an audio frame and a corresponding video frame is more than 2 seconds, 
      the audio frame will be played at the timestamp of the video frame. 

      If this parameter is set to `dts`, no synchronization is performed.
