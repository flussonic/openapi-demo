  prefer_codec:
    description: |
      Choose one of the listed video codecs at the start of the publication via WebRTC.
    allOf:
    - $ref: '../../schemas.yml#/webrtc_prefer_codec'
    example: av1
  transport:
    description: |
      Choose the prefered transport of the publication via WebRTC: UDP or TCP.
    allOf:

    example: udp
  min_bitrate:
    description: The minimum bitrate threshold, in kbit/s. The default value is 100 kbit/s.
    type: integer
    example: 150
  webrtc_abr:
    description: Whether the adaptive bitrate mechanism is used for WebRTC publications.
    type: boolean
    example: true
  abr_stepup:
    description: |
      Increment step for raising the bitrate to the maximum, in percent. The default step is 30%. 
      If the loss is less than `abr_loss_lower`, Flussonic makes the publisher to step up from the current bitrate to the maximum one with the rate of `abr_stepup percent`.
    type: integer
  abr_correction:
    description: |
      The correction between the target bitrate (Receiver Estimated Maximum Bitrate, calculated in Flussonic) and browser bitrate, in kbit/s.
      Flussonic sends the target bitrate to the browser from which the publication is carried out so that the browser adjusts the bitrate of the publication by this value.
      The default value is 300 kbit/s.
    type: integer
    example: 200
  abr_loss_lower:
    type: number
    description: |
      The lower limit of packet loss. When it is reached, Flussonic raises the bitrate. 
      That is, if packet loss is less than `abr_loss_lower`, Flussonic makes the publisher to step up from the current bitrate to the maximum one with the rate of `abr_stepup` percent.
    example: 2
  abr_loss_upper:
    description: |
      The upper limit of packet loss. When it is reached, Flussonic reduces the bitrate. 
      That is, if packet loss is greater than `abr_loss_upper`, Flussonic makes the publisher to reduce the current bitrate in steps with the maximum rate of `abr_stepdown` percent.
    type: number
    example: 10
  abr_stepdown:
    description: |
      A step of reducing the bitrate to the minimum. 
      If packet losses are greater than `abr_loss_upper`, Flussonic makes the publisher to reduce the current bitrate in steps with the maximum rate of `abr_stepdown` percent.
    type: number
  abr_mode:
    description: |
      The algorithm for determining the need to change the bitrate of the published stream and for calculating the target bitrate. 
      Two options are possible:

      * `abr_mode=0` - This mode takes into account the packet losses, target bitrate, browser bitrate and the number of auto-adjustment cycles.
      * `abr_mode=1` - This mode considers only packet losses and target bitrate.
    type: integer
    example: 1
  abr_debug:
    description: Whether adaptive bitrate process is logged.
    type: integer
    example: 1
  abr_cycles:
    description: |
      The number of cycles of bitrate auto-adjustment.
      After the specified number of auto-adjustment cycles passes, Flussonic considers the bitrate to be optimal, and it is no longer analyzed. 
      By default, `abr_cycles`=5. 
      If `abr_cycles`=0, the adjustment process takes place all the time while the publication lasts.
    type: integer
    example: 3
