      Explicit list of countries (two-letter country codes according to ISO 3166-1) that have access to the content without any other checks. 
      
      Flussonic uses the MaxMind GeoLite2 Country database to map a country to a block of IP addresses. 
      New releases of GeoIP2 databases come out more often than the releases of Flussonic server, so sometimes the used database can become outdated. 
      Therefore we recommend you to install a separate GeoIP2 library and set up Flussonic to use it.

  soft_limitation:
    description: |
      If this option is enabled and `max_sessions` limitation is used, the extra sessions are interrupted not immediately, but in 30 or 90 seconds.
      This can be useful for middlewares that cannot generate a new token for every new stream or file request 
      and therefore need time to understand that all sessions are being used.

  session_keys:
    description: |
      A list of keys to generate a session ID value, allowing to configure the authorization scheme 
      which is a hash sum calculated as follows: `hash(name + ip + proto)`.
      This parameter allows to finish one session and start another one with the same authorization token.
      The keys `name`,`ip`, and `proto` are required.
