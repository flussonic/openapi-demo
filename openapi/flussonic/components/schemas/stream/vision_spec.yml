  areas:
    description: |
      This parameter allows you to select specific polygonal area(s) to detect license plates (works only for `alg = plates`).
      By default, it is empty and the recognition system searches for license plates over all the camera field of view.
      
      Each area is specified as a sequence of comma-separated coordinates of vertices of the polygon: `x0,y0,x1,y1,x2,y2,...`.
      The vertices are specified in a counter-clockwise direction. Multiple areas are separated by `:`.
    type: string
