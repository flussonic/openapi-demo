    description: |
      PID of Program Map Table (PMT) in the outgoing MPEG-TS stream.

      PMT contains the description of each program and lists the PIDs of elementary streams associated with that program.
      For instance, a transport stream used in digital television might contain three programs, to represent three television channels. 
      Suppose each channel consists of one video stream, one or two audio streams, and any necessary metadata. 
      A receiver wishing to decode one of the three channels merely has to decode the payloads of each PID associated with its program. 
      It can discard the contents of all other PIDs.

    description: |
      Frame rate (frames per second) - the speed at which a sequence of images is displayed on a screen.
      Higher frame rates capture more images per second, which makes for smoother video.

      The standard frame rate for color television in the Phase Alternating Line (PAL) format is 25 fps.
      The standard frame rate for color television in the National Television System Committee (NTSC) format is 29,97 fps
      (a little bit lower than the original frame rate of black and white NTSC television, equal to 30 fps.)
      If interlaced TV is used, two fields of each frame (with odd-numbered lines and with even-numbered lines) are displayed consequently,
      but the frame rate is actually not doubled (50 half-frames are still equal to 25 original frames).

      The Decklink capture mode supported by a card. 
      Usually a Decklink card supports a limited set of modes. 
      Each mode is a combination of a frame size and FPS, encoded in Decklink format.
      For example, `Hp50` is for 1920x1080 size with 50.00 FPS.

      You can set this value manually or set size and FPS, and Flussonic will try to choose the appropriate format.

      You can choose only one algorithm at a time. 
      If a pushing stream has the same video resolution as an ingest stream, the `fast_bilinear` algorithm is used by default. 
      If a video resolution of a pushing stream does not equal the video resolution of an ingest stream, the bicubic algorithm is used by default. 
      If the algorithm is specified explicitly, it applies to all the formats.

      Temporary disabling, or pausing, an offline stream eliminates the necessity to remove it from the the configuration in order to stop Flussonic trying to push it. 
      In this way, the URL and other settings of a disabled stream remain in Flussonic.

  streamid:
    description: |
      A string of maximum 512 characters set on the socket before the connection. 

      This string is a part of a callback that is sent by the caller and regisered by the listener. 
      Based on this information the listener can accept or reject the connection, select the desired data stream, or set an appropriate passphrase for the connection.

      Its format is `#!::` optionally followed by the parameters:
      * `r=` - stream name
      * `m=` - mode expected for connection: `publish` (if the caller wants to send the stream data) or `request` (if the caller wants to receive the stream).
 
      During SRT sessions the following parameters are automaticly added to `streamid`:
      * `s=` - the identifier of a session
      * `a=` - Flussonic verion

      NOTE: you can specify a string in the format you need; to disable this extension, you need specify empty string.
