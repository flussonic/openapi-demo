  connect_timeout:
    description: Connection timeout, in seconds. Equals to 0 by default.
    type: integer
    example: 100
  linger:
    description: |

  latency:
    description: |
      Packet delivery delay.

    type: integer
    example: 100
  streamid:
    description: |
      A string of maximum 512 characters set on the socket before the connection. 

      This string is a part of a callback that is sent by the caller and regisered by the listener. 
      Based on this information the listener can accept or reject the connection, select the desired data stream, or set an appropriate passphrase for the connection.

      Its format is `#!::` optionally followed by the parameters:
      * `r=` - stream name
      * `m=` - mode expected for the connection: `publish` (if the caller wants to send the stream data) or `request` (if the caller wants to receive the stream).
      * `password=` - a password for the authorization in a publish session (not recommended, better use `passphrase` option instead)
 
      During SRT sessions the following parameters are automaticly added to streamid:
      * `s=` - the identifier of a session
      * `a=` - Flussonic version

      NOTE: you can specify a string in the format you need; to disable this extension, you need specify empty string.
    type: string
    example: "#!::r=my-stream,m=publish"
