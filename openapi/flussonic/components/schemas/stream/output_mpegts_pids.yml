      PID  of the elementary stream that contains Program Map Table (PMT) in the outgoing MPEG-TS stream.

      PMT contains the description of each program and lists the PIDs of elementary streams associated with that program.
      For instance, a transport stream used in digital television might contain three programs, to represent three television channels. 
      Suppose each channel consists of one video stream, one or two audio streams, and any necessary metadata. 
      A receiver wishing to decode one of the three channels merely has to decode the payloads of each PID associated with its program. 
      It can discard the contents of all other PIDs.

      PID of the elementary stream that contains PCR (Program Clock Reference) in the outgoing MPEG-TS stream.

      PCR is the time label used for synchronization of a stream playback with real time. 
      Additionally, for DVB streams it is used for managing a decoder and its buffer. 
      In this case, PCR gives a signal to the frames with DTS<PCR to be sent to the decoder from the buffer. 
      This mechanism allows to compensate different sizes of frames: if a frame is too big to be played in time with a specified FPS, the frames from the buffer are played.

      The default algorithm of selecting PID for a track.

      * `auto`: track PID = PMT PID + track ID, 
      where PMT PID is the PID of Program Map Table and track ID is a number of the track set by Flussonic 
      (usually, all video tracks and then all audio tracks are numbered starting from 1).
      * `increment`: track PID = previous track PID + 1.
