      The storage (on the disk or on another server) that Flussonic will scan for VOD files.
      If it is a path on the disk, it should be specified relating to the disk root.

      It is possible to specify multiple storages for one VOD location. When Flussonic gets the URL for playing the file, it finds the prefix in this URL, 
      cuts the path after it and consequently searches for this path in all specified storages.
