    The default mode.
- title: Migrate
  const: migrate
  description: |
    Flussonic migrates the data from the current hard drive to other hard drives in the array on the fly, cleaning up the current hard drive.
    You can check that Flussonic finished migrating the data, when there aren't any calls to this hard drive.
    In the meantime, Flussonic continues archive recording, so it isn't interrupted. You don't need to restart Flussonic after you remove the disk.
    Use this option if you need to extract the hard drive and don't want to lose the data.
- title: Readonly
  const: readonly
  description: |
    Flussonic reads the data from the hard drive, restricting any writing to it. Use this option in the following cases:  
    Flussonic reads the data from the hard drive until the data on it expires. Then Flussonic deletes the data.
    * If the hard drive is worn out and you can't write the data to the hard drive, delete files, update the index, or copy the data to another hard drive.
    * If the hard drive stores the records written in the `keep` mode and you want to store the data permanently.
- title: Rescue
  const: rescue
  description: |
    Flussonic copies all the data from the old hard drive that's going to fail and stops writing the data to this hard drive.
    Flussonic doesn't delete the data from the hard drive, unlike in `migrate` mode, so you can still access the archive.
    Use this option in an emergency.
- title: Abandon
  const: abandon
  description: |
    Flussonic stops writing new data on this hard drive. When the data becomes obsolete, Flussonic deletes it, updating the index. 
    Use this option when you want to replace a hard drive, for example, with a larger one.
- title: Keep
  const: keep
  description: |
    Flussonic writes the data to the hard drive, but doesn't delete it.
    Use this option if you need to store the entire archive permanently.
