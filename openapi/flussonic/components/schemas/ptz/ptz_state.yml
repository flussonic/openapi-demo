      After turning on IP camera with PTZ motor needs to calibrate: move far to each direction
      and after this, it is possible to predict position and enable absolute positioning.

      During this process, it is not possible to execute PTZ commands and current state is `calibrating`.

      This value can be `NULL` when ONVIF camera doesn't tell about such state or we haven't asked it yet.
  is_moving:
    type: boolean
    nullable: true

      Sometimes it is possible to tell that camera is not still and it is moving right now.

      This value can be `NULL` when ONVIF camera doesn't tell this information.
